# Explanation of folders:

- *Deforestation_mapping*: this directory contains all the scripts used to train and test the segmentation networks (training_forest.ipynb and clustering_forest.ipynb). The DataPostProcessing.ipynb notebook contains the script used to extract information from the segmentation output and from the nc file (for weather data).

- *Ontology*: this directory contains the SORSOntology owl file (plus SOSA and WeatherOntology ontologies). Moreover, there are some Python files used to populate the ontology, query on it and reason on it.
